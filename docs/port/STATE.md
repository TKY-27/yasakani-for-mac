# Project state

This file is the single resumable record of the port. It is written so the
orchestrator can continue from it alone. Update it at every merge, decision
and measurement.

Last updated: 2026-11-14 (step 1 in progress).

## Goal and release criteria

A from-scratch Rust engine for Apple Silicon that runs Qwen3.8-27B from the
published YASAKANI `.yskn` files with quality equal to upstream. Unofficial,
Apache-2.0. The work ends at release-ready; publishing is the owner's step.

Release criteria (all must hold):

1. Perplexity of the fastest model with the int8 cache agrees with upstream's
   2.075900 over 20,460 positions within 0.001, with the shipping
   configuration. The KV5 configuration matches its record (2.075937) equally
   closely.
2. Every fast path equals the scalar reference bit for bit in the test suite.
3. Speculation on/off gives the same token sequence for greedy and seeded
   sampling across a varied prompt set; repeated runs are identical.
4. A one-hour mixed workload at 32,768-token context: no crash, no memory
   growth, no swapping.
5. Server passes its API tests, including streaming and tool calls.
6. A worker given only the README builds from a fresh clone, runs a chat and
   the benchmark, and reports no guessing.
7. CI passes on main: formatting, lints as errors, tests.
8. A model that wrote none of the code has reviewed the whole repository for
   correctness and server security; findings resolved.
9. Licence files and notices correct; README states unofficial status,
   hardware needs and what was not tested.
10. This file ends with a release summary.

## Build order

1. Close gaps D7 to D9; mixed-model tests pass. **In progress.**
2. Fast CPU path for the compressed linear operator (threaded NEON, run-time
   feature choice, portable fallback), bit-identical, model memory-mapped.
3. Validate the main model with `score_windows` (gate for everything later).
4. Backend decision by measurement (NEON vs Metal at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 rows).
5. Draft model, speculation loop, prompt snapshots, long-prompt prefill, KV5.
6. Product binary: terminal chat, OpenAI-compatible server, benchmark.
7. Optimization to the machine limit (stop after five attempts under 2%).
8. Other Macs: feature detection, forced fallbacks, memory check at start.
9. SwiftUI chat app (only after the engine passes every criterion; tag first).
10. Repository cleanup and documents written from nothing.

## Environment (observed 2026-11-14)

- Machine: Apple M5 family, 10 cores (4 performance, 6 efficiency), 24 GB
  (`sysctl hw.memsize` = 25769803776), macOS 27.2.1, rustc 1.100.0.
- Model folder (never commit, never copy): `~/models/qwen38-speed/`.
  Contains `qwen38_27b_speed.yskn` (10,311,344,128 bytes), `bdraft2_k8.yskn`,
  `bdraft2_k8.shead`, `kvq_u5.bin`, `tokenizer.json`, `chat_template.jinja`,
  `yasakani.json`, `selfcheck.json`.
- GitHub: `gh` logged in as TKY-27 with repo and workflow scopes.
- Codex CLI 0.166.0, ChatGPT login active.

## How the work is run

- The orchestrator (Claude Fable) directs and verifies; it does not implement.
- Routing fixed by the owner:
  - Implementation and code review: `gpt-6.1-sol` through the Codex plugin.
  - Optimization, UI and general tasks: Opus 5.5 subagents.
  - Hard problems (numeric mismatch root cause, kernel memory layout):
    `gpt-6-astra` through the Codex plugin.
  - Mechanical edits: `gpt-6-luna` through the Codex plugin.
  - The reviewer of a change is never its author. Sol-written changes are
    reviewed by Opus 5.5 or Astra; Opus-written changes by Sol.
- Briefs live in `.work/briefs/` (ignored by git). A worker sees only its brief.
- One process at a time may load the real model. Timing runs happen with no
  other project process running.
- Feature branches, pull requests, CI green and a cross-model review before
  each merge to main.

## Decisions

D1 to D6 are in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). Owner-decided gaps:

- **D7** exp2(t) = portable exp of the binary32 product t × ln 2
  (bits 0x3f317218). Reason: upstream calls `exp2f(x * log2e)` and has no
  portable exp2; this is the closest construction from portable parts.
- **D8** For arch `qwen3_5` the rotary width is the constant 64 and the loader
  requires `head_dim == 256`, as upstream hard-codes. Stated exception to D5.
- **D9** Each query row visits the absolute 32-slot tiles that intersect its
  own prefix range and no others. A masked key has score −∞ and probability
  +0.0 and takes no part in value accumulation. A row's result must not
  depend on which other rows share the pass.

Orchestrator decisions:

- **O1 (2026-11-14)** The pstack Orchestrate playbook's external store and
  `orch` CLI are not used; this file is the store. Reason: the owner requires
  that the work be resumable from this file alone, and forbids changes
  outside the repository.
- **O2 (2026-11-14)** `target/` and `.work/` are ignored by git. Reason:
  build output was showing as untracked; briefs and worker reports are
  transient.

## Progress log

| Date | Step | What | Evidence |

## Measurements

None yet. Every entry here must carry the exact command that produced it.

## Blocked on the owner

Nothing.
