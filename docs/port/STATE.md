# Project state

This file is the single resumable record of the port. It is written so the
orchestrator can continue from it alone. Update it at every merge, decision
and measurement.

Last updated: 2026-11-14 (steps 1 and 2 merged; step 3 engine model in progress; Metal probe for step 4 started early).

## Goal and release criteria

A from-scratch Rust engine for Apple Silicon that runs Qwen3.8-27B from the
published YASAKANI `.yskn` files with quality equal to upstream. Unofficial,
Apache-2.0. The work ends at release-ready; publishing is the owner's step.

Release criteria (all must hold):

1. Perplexity of the fastest model with the int8 cache agrees with upstream's
   2.075900 over 20,460 positions within 0.001, with the shipping
   configuration. The KV5 configuration matches its record (2.075937) equally
   closely.
2. Every fast path equals the scalar reference bit for bit in the test suite.
3. Speculation on/off gives the same token sequence for greedy and seeded
   sampling across a varied prompt set; repeated runs are identical.
4. A one-hour mixed workload at 32,768-token context: no crash, no memory
   growth, no swapping.
5. Server passes its API tests, including streaming and tool calls.
6. A worker given only the README builds from a fresh clone, runs a chat and
   the benchmark, and reports no guessing.
7. CI passes on main: formatting, lints as errors, tests.
8. A model that wrote none of the code has reviewed the whole repository for
   correctness and server security; findings resolved.
9. Licence files and notices correct; README states unofficial status,
   hardware needs and what was not tested.
10. This file ends with a release summary.

## Build order

1. Close gaps D7 to D9; mixed-model tests pass. **Done (PR #3).**
2. Fast CPU path for the compressed linear operator (threaded NEON, run-time
   feature choice, portable fallback), bit-identical, model memory-mapped.
   **Done (PR #4).** Crate `crates/yskn-engine`; design in DECISIONS D10.
3. Validate the main model with `score_windows` (gate for everything later).
   **In progress.** Brief `.work/briefs/02b-engine-model.md` (Sol), worktree
   `.work/wt/02b`, branch `feat/02b-engine-model`: layer-major engine model
   that reuses the reference's scalar functions, bit-identity tests, and
   `score_windows` / `verify_model` examples in `yskn-engine`. When it is
   verified, the orchestrator runs the full 20-window score (over an hour,
   nothing else running on the model).
4. Backend decision by measurement (NEON vs Metal at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 rows).
   **Probe started early** (it does not depend on the main model): brief
   `.work/briefs/04a-metal-probe.md` (Astra), worktree `.work/wt/04a`,
   branch `feat/04a-metal-probe`, synthetic data only. The orchestrator
   runs `bench_metal` on the real model on a quiet machine afterwards.
5. Draft model, speculation loop, prompt snapshots, long-prompt prefill, KV5.
6. Product binary: terminal chat, OpenAI-compatible server, benchmark.
7. Optimization to the machine limit (stop after five attempts under 2%).
8. Other Macs: feature detection, forced fallbacks, memory check at start.
9. SwiftUI chat app (only after the engine passes every criterion; tag first).
10. Repository cleanup and documents written from nothing.

## Environment (observed 2026-11-14)

- Machine: Apple M5 family, 10 cores (4 performance, 6 efficiency), 24 GB
  (`sysctl hw.memsize` = 25769803776), macOS 27.2.1, rustc 1.100.0.
- Model folder (never commit, never copy): `~/models/qwen38-speed/`.
  Contains `qwen38_27b_speed.yskn` (10,311,344,128 bytes), `bdraft2_k8.yskn`,
  `bdraft2_k8.shead`, `kvq_u5.bin`, `tokenizer.json`, `chat_template.jinja`,
  `yasakani.json`, `selfcheck.json`.
- GitHub: `gh` logged in as TKY-27 with repo and workflow scopes.
- Codex CLI 0.166.0, ChatGPT login active.

## How the work is run

- The orchestrator (Claude Fable) directs and verifies; it does not implement.
- Routing fixed by the owner:
  - Implementation and code review: `gpt-6.1-sol` through the Codex plugin.
  - Optimization, UI and general tasks: Opus 5.5 subagents.
  - Hard problems (numeric mismatch root cause, kernel memory layout):
    `gpt-6-astra` through the Codex plugin.
  - Mechanical edits: `gpt-6-luna` through the Codex plugin.
  - The reviewer of a change is never its author. Sol-written changes are
    reviewed by Opus 5.5 or Astra; Opus-written changes by Sol.
- Briefs live in `.work/briefs/` (ignored by git). A worker sees only its brief.
- One process at a time may load the real model. Timing runs happen with no
  other project process running.
- Feature branches, pull requests, CI green and a cross-model review before
  each merge to main.
- Codex workers sometimes cannot write `.git` (sandbox). Briefs ask them to
  leave work staged; the orchestrator commits after running the proof.
- Parallel workers get their own git worktree under `.work/wt/`.

## Decisions

D1 to D10 are in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) (D10: mapped CPU kernel
design, by Astra). Owner-decided gaps:

- **D7** exp2(t) = portable exp of the binary32 product t × ln 2
  (bits 0x3f317218). Reason: upstream calls `exp2f(x * log2e)` and has no
  portable exp2; this is the closest construction from portable parts.
- **D8** For arch `qwen3_5` the rotary width is the constant 64 and the loader
  requires `head_dim == 256`, as upstream hard-codes. Stated exception to D5.
- **D9** Each query row visits the absolute 32-slot tiles that intersect its
  own prefix range and no others. A masked key has score −∞ and probability
  +0.0 and takes no part in value accumulation. A row's result must not
  depend on which other rows share the pass.

Orchestrator decisions:

- **O1 (2026-11-14)** The pstack Orchestrate playbook's external store and
  `orch` CLI are not used; this file is the store. Reason: the owner requires
  that the work be resumable from this file alone, and forbids changes
  outside the repository.
- **O2 (2026-11-14)** `target/` and `.work/` are ignored by git. Reason:
  build output was showing as untracked; briefs and worker reports are
  transient.

- **O3 (2026-11-14)** Commits that change only this file go through a pull
  request and CI but need no cross-model review. Reason: the file is the
  orchestrator's own record, not code; a review would add nothing.
- **O4 (2026-11-14)** The Metal probe for step 4 runs in parallel with
  step 3 on synthetic data. Reason: the CPU kernel is compute-bound at
  about 15 GB/s, far from the 307 GB/s ceiling, so the backend choice is
  the largest open question and does not depend on the main-model gate.
  Nothing is built on it until step 3 passes.
- **O5 (2026-11-14)** The engine's main model reuses the reference's scalar
  functions for everything except the compressed linear kernel, and only
  changes the loop order to layer-major. Reason: least new code, and
  bit-identity follows from sharing the functions; faster replacements
  come one at a time in step 7, each with its own bit-identity test.

## Progress log

| Date | Step | What | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-14 | 0 | PR #2 found already merged; CI green on main at d161397 | `gh pr list --state all`, `gh run list` |
| 2026-11-14 | 1 | D7 to D9 implemented by Sol (75271d6). Opus review: code correct, tests could not detect a wrong tile schedule. Sol fix round (8ee8520): `prefix_schedule()` tested against hand-written schedules, pinned bits. 61 tests pass, none ignored. | `cargo test --workspace --release`; `! grep -rnE 'todo!\|unimplemented!\|#\[ignore\|SpecGap' crates/` |

| 2026-11-14 | 2 | Astra built `yskn-engine` (mmap, pool, portable/NEON/dotprod kernels). Sol review: approve, one test nit. Orchestrator ran all checks. | `cargo run --release -p yskn-engine --example verify_linear -- MODEL.yskn` (12 of 12 PASS) |

## Known debts

- Pool test nit from the Sol review of PR #4: add a case where a job fails
  with i64 overflow (row layout, bits 6, N=96, K=264704, table all 1.0,
  activations all -128, scales all i32::MIN) and the same engine then
  succeeds on a zero input.
- `MappedModel::open` is an `unsafe fn` (file must not change while mapped).
  The product binary needs a safe wrapper that documents this.


## Measurements

Every entry carries the exact command that produced it.

### M1: CPU kernel, full pass of the compressed linear operator (2026-11-14)

Command (nothing else running, model resident after warm-up):
`cargo run --release -p yskn-engine --example bench_linear -- ~/models/qwen38-speed/qwen38_27b_speed.yskn`

Commit fe8ae4a (merged as 4bb0cab). Kernel dotprod, 10 threads, 401
matrices, 9,758,310,400 code bytes per pass, 7 passes after one warm-up.

| Rows (M) | Median ms | Minimum ms | Read rate GB/s (median) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 645.8 | 634.6 | 15.1 |
| 2 | 671.5 | 665.2 | 14.5 |
| 4 | 757.7 | 746.3 | 12.9 |
| 8 | 924.0 | 908.8 | 10.6 |
| 16 | 1247.6 | 1234.1 | 7.8 |

Reading: the ideal at 307 GB/s is about 32 ms, so the kernel is
compute-bound by a factor of about 20. The decode is scalar (one table
lookup per pair of weights, bounds-checked) and each added row costs about
40 ms. CPU features present: NEON, dotprod, i8mm, SME, SME2
(`sysctl hw.optional.arm`).

## Blocked on the owner

Nothing.
